Here are 5 concise, business-appropriate questions to clarify the requirements for the first grid:

1. Could you please confirm the logic used to calculate the "Total" column — is it a sum of specific rows, filtered data, or something else?
2. What specific condition or threshold is being used to apply the grey background highlight to certain rows?
3. In the first grid, on what basis are the rows marked for attention or highlighted — is it based on exception, mismatch, or status?
4. Why are only six rows visible — is there a fixed row limit or is it data-driven?
5. Is the data being grouped or sorted in any specific order before the highlights and totals are applied?
